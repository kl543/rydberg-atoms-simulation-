# Rydberg Polaritons: Time-Evolution & Relative-Phase Dynamics

Minimal repository showcasing numerical visualizations of relative-phase evolution for two and three Rydberg polaritons in a quasi-1D medium under blockade. Assets include short simulation videos and matching schematic figures.

## Contents
- `.github/workflows/` — CI configuration (e.g., Pages build).
- `figures/schematics/` — Schematic diagrams matching the videos (PNG/SVG), showing geometry, blockade radius R_b, centers z_i, and group velocities v_gi.
- `scripts/` — Lightweight utilities (e.g., `gen_docs.py`) for organizing assets or generating docs.
- `thesis/` — Project write-up and notes (placeholder).
- `videos/` — MP4 clips:
  - `Relative-Phase Evolution of Two Rydberg Polaritons.mp4`
  - `Relative-Phase Evolution of Three Rydberg Polaritons.mp4`

## Notes
- File stems are consistent between videos and figures (images use the same stem with `_schematic`).
- PNG provided for GitHub preview; SVG recommended for print/latex.
